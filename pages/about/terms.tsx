        &quot;DMCA Notice&quot;) must include substantially the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of
          an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
        </li>
        <li>

          representative list of such works at that site;
        </li>
        <li>
          Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of
          infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and
          information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
        </li>
        <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party;</li>
        <li>
          A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in
          the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
          and
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of
          perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
          exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Our copyright agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement on the Services is:</p>

        <br />
        [Insert Address]
        <br />
        [Insert Email]
      </p>

      <p>
        If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is
        not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright
        owner&apos;s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your User
        Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to our copyright
        agent:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
        <li>
          Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled
          and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as
          a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
        </li>
        <li>

          the jurisdiction of the federal court in [Insert Jurisdiction], and a statement that you
          will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged
          infringement.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If a counter-notice is received by our copyright agent, we may send a copy of the
        counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace
        the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner
        files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the
        removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more
        after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Termination</h2>

      <p>
        We may terminate your access to the Services, without cause or notice, at any time. We may
        also terminate or suspend your access to the Services if you breach any of these Terms or
        any applicable laws or regulations. Upon any termination, discontinuation, or cancellation
        of Services or your account, all provisions of these Terms which by their nature should
        survive will survive, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty
        disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

      <p>
        Your access to and use of the Services or any content is at your own risk. You understand
        and agree that the Services are provided to you on an &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS
        AVAILABLE&quot; basis. Without limiting the foregoing, PORTFOLIO LAB, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND
        AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. We make no warranty and disclaim all responsibility
        and liability for the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security, or
        reliability of the Services or any content. We will not be responsible or liable for any
        harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to
        or use of the Services or any content.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PORTFOLIO LAB, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND
        AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
        OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL,
        USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF PORTFOLIO LAB HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES).
      </p>

      <h2>16. Indemnification</h2>

      <p>
        You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Portfolio Lab, its subsidiaries, and
        affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents,
        licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities,
        damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable
        attorneys&apos; fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms or your
        use of the Services, including, but not limited to, your User Content, any use of the
        Services&apos; content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these
        Terms or your use of any information obtained from the Services.
      </p>

      <h2>17. Dispute Resolution</h2>

      <p>
        Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Services will be resolved by
        binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims
        court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply
        to this agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
        arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the
        same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory
        damages), and must follow these Terms as a court would.
      </p>

      <p>
        We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an
        individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any
        reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a
        jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement
        or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
      </p>

      <h2>18. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>

      <p>
        These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the [Insert
        Jurisdiction] without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction
        and venue of any action with respect to the subject matter of these Terms will be the state
        and federal courts located in [Insert Jurisdiction], and each of the parties hereto waives
        any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. The application of the United
        Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
      </p>

      <h2>19. Waiver and Severability</h2>

      <p>
        No waiver by us of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further
        or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition,
        and any failure of us to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute
        a waiver of such right or provision.
      </p>

      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent
        jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall
        be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the
        Terms will continue in full force and effect.
      </p>

      <h2>20. Entire Agreement</h2>

      <p>
        These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between us
        regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or
        written understandings or agreements between us regarding the Services.
      </p>

      <h2>21. Assignment</h2>

      <p>
        You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our
        prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such
        consent, will be null and of no effect. We may assign or transfer these Terms, at our sole
        discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure
        to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
      </p>
